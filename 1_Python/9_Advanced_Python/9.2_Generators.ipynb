      "\n",
      "1. Role:\n",
      "- The President of India serves as the ceremonial head of state and represents the unity, integrity, and symmetry of the nation.\n",
      "- The position is mainly symbolic, while executive powers are exercised by the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Election Process:\n",
      "- Elected by an Electoral College that includes elected members of both houses of Parliament and the Legislative Assemblies of the States.\n",
      "- The election system is a proportional representation using the Single Transferable Vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Historical Facts:\n",
      "- The first President of India was Dr. Rajendra Prasad, who took office in 1950.\n",
      "- Over the years, several Presidents have served, each contributing in their own way to the fabric of Indian democracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Residence and Ceremonial Duties:\n",
      "- The official residence is the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi, an architectural landmark and a symbol of the nation.\n",
      "- Besides ceremonial functions, the President plays a crucial role during times of political uncertainty or national crises.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Miscellaneous:\n",
      "- The President has the power to grant pardons, reprieves, and remissions of punishment, which is an important check within the judicial system.\n",
      "- Cultural engagement: The President often represents India on the global stage, promoting its rich history and cultural heritage.\n",
      "- Although often described as â€˜the first citizenâ€™ of India, the role is more about upholding constitutional values than wielding executive power.\n",
      "\n",
